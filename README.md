A Tornado server using websockets to let a DM give their players minigames to play instead of rolling for skill checks.

Check out the files in `games` to see some tiny javascript minigames that I made! I like making these little games in js because it becomes so easy to script simple reactive behavior to user input. If you're not trying to make a game with complicated inter-object interactions and physics, then often, solid interface behavior is most of what you need - and if all you need is good interface behavior, why program it yourself when you can just use a browser? Plus, I can draw things with SVG, which has just as much tie-in to user events.

It's just so easy!
